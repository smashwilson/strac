# What is Strac?

"Strac" is a Trac plugin that interfaces with VisualWorks Smalltalk's STORE
version control system.  It works by querying the STORE database directly,
then doing a certain amount of source formatting.

In its current state, Strac works with Trac 0.10 and the PostgreSQL database.
Support for Trac 0.11 and at least the flexibility to interface with other
databases is forthcoming.  While it offers full browsing of classes, methods,
namespaces, class extensions and shared variable definitions, it does not yet
provide a graceful way to view individual "commit" contents, package blessing
levels, or "real" revision histories.  Also, it may or may not have a fairly
serious bug about not releasing database connections properly.  In other words,
the "use at your own risk" disclaimer applies unusually strongly here.
